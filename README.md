## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of responsive design with Tailwind, particularly using:

- Responsive background image switching:

  ```html
  class="bg-[url('/images/bg-mobile.png')]
  lg:bg-[url('/images/bg-desktop.png')]"
  ```

- Tailwind’s utility-first approach really improved my speed and consistency.

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my Tailwind skills by exploring more complex layout techniques, animation utilities, and incorporating accessibility best practices (e.g., better ARIA usage for interactive elements).

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – The official documentation was essential for responsive utilities and layout techniques.
- [Frontend Mentor Discord](https://discord.gg/frontendmentor) – Helpful for quick feedback and tips.
